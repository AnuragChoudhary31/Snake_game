# Snake Game

## Overview
This is a classic Snake game implemented in Java using the BlueJ IDE. The objective of the game is to control the snake, move it around the grid, and collect as many items (or "food") as possible without running into the walls or the snake's own body.

## Features
- Classic Snake gameplay
- Simple and intuitive controls
- Score tracking
- Game over detection

## Installation
To run this game, you need to have the BlueJ IDE installed. You can download BlueJ from [here](https://www.bluej.org/).

1. **Open the project in BlueJ**:
   - Launch BlueJ.
   - Open the project folder.

## Usage
1. **Run the Game**:
   - Inside BlueJ, right-click on the `Main` class and select `void main(String[] args)` to start the game.

2. **Controls**:
   - Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
   - Collect food items to grow the snake and increase your score.
   - Avoid running into the walls or the snake's own body.

- **Food**: Food items appear randomly on the grid. Eating food makes the snake grow longer.
- **Game Over**: The game ends if the snake runs into the walls or its own body.
